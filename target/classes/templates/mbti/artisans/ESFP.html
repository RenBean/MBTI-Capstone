<p>ESFPs Are Practical
<br/>ESFPs tend to be very practical and resourceful. They prefer to learn through hands-on experience and tend to dislike book learning and theoretical discussions. Because of this, students with ESFP personality types sometimes struggle in traditional classroom settings. However, they excel in situations where they are allowed to interact with others or learn through direct experience.
</p>

<p>When solving problems, they trust their instincts and put trust in their own abilities to come up with a solution. While they are reasonable and pragmatic, they dislike structure, order, and planning. Instead ,they act spontaneously and do not spend a great deal of time coming up with a plan or schedule.
</p>

<p>ESFPs Are Extroverted
<br/>As extroverts, ESFPs enjoy spending time with other people and have excellent interpersonal skills. They are good at understanding how other people are feelings and are able to respond to other people's emotions in productive ways. For this reason, ESFPs can make good leaders and have a knack for mobilizing, motivating and persuading group members.
</p>

<p>ESFPs are often described as warm, kind and thoughtful, making them popular and well-liked by others. ESFPs enjoy meeting new people, but they also have a thirst for new experiences. They are generally focused on the present and will often be the first person to try the newest ride at an amusement park or try out a new adventure sport.
