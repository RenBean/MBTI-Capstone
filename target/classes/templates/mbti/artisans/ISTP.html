<h1>ISTP</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Introversion (I): How you direct your energy and relate to the world around you. ISTPs tend to be quiet and reserved.</li>
    <li>Sensing (S): How you take in information from the environment. ISTPs prefer concrete information rather than abstract or theoretical concepts.</li>
    <li>Thinking (T): How you make decisions. ISTPs make decisions based upon logic rather than subjective emotions.</li>
    <li>Perceiving (P): How you orient yourself to the outside world. ISTPs prefer not to plan things out in advance and like to keep their options open.</li>
</ul>

<p>ISTPs Are Easy-Going, but Action-Oriented
<br/>People with an ISTP personality are results-oriented. When there is a problem, they want to quickly understand the underlying cause and implement some type of solution. ISTPs are often described as quiet, but with an easy-going attitude towards others.
</p>

<p>ISTPs Enjoy New Experiences
<br/>ISTPs enjoy new experiences and may often engage in thrill-seeking or even risk-taking behaviors. They often engage in risky or fast-paced hobbies such as motorcycling, hang gliding, bungee jumping, surfing or ice hockey. In some cases, they may seek out adventure by choosing careers in areas such as racing, flying, or firefighting.
</p>

<p>ISTPs Are Logical
<br/>ISTPs tend to be very logical and enjoy learning and understanding how things operate. They might take apart a mechanical device just to see how it works. While they are good at understanding abstract and theoretical information, they are not particularly interested in such things unless they can see some type of practical application.
<br/>Because they are so logical, ISTPs are good at looking at situations in an objective way and avoiding subjective or emotional factors when making decisions. People with this personality type can be difficult to get to know, often because they are focused so much on action and results rather than on emotions.
</p>

<p>ISTPs prefer to focus on the present and take on things one day at a time. They often avoid making long-term commitments and would rather focus on the "here and now" rather than think about future plans and possibilities.
