<h1>Artisan Profile</h1>

<p><b>Artisans</b> are concrete in speech and utilitarian in pursuing their goals. Their greatest strength is tactical variation.
</p>
<p>As the stimulation-seeking temperament, Artisans prefer to live one day at a time. They may spontaneously pursue activities that offer fun or pleasure. Artisans tend to be more permissive as parents than the other temperaments, wanting their children to explore and enjoy the world.
</p>
<p><b>Interests:</b> In education, Artisans tend to seek work involving operations and equipment, which could range from a scalpel to a fighter jet.
</p>
<p><b>Orientation:</b> Artisans live in the here and now. They want to enjoy the present moment. They tend to be optimistic about the future and cynical about the past, believing that life is a series of risks or random events without any larger pattern or meaning.
</p>
<p><b>Self-image:</b> The Artisans' self-esteem is rooted in their grace and artistry; their self-respect in their boldness; and their self-confidence in their adaptability.
</p>
<p><b>Values:</b> Artisans perform well when in a state of restless energy. "They are excitable as children and they never seem to get less excitable as they grow up."[2] They seek stimulation and trust their impulses. Prone to spontaneous acts, they want to make an impact on others. They aspire to virtuosity, taking great pleasure in practicing and mastering their technique in the pursuits that interest them.
</p>
<p><b>Social roles:</b> In romantic relationships, Artisans want a playmate, someone who can share in the pleasure and excitement they seek. As parents, Artisans are liberators, exposing their children to a wide variety of activities, encouraging them to push beyond their limits, and guiding them toward independence and self-sufficiency.
</p>
<p><b>Learning:</b> Artisans want teachers who are interesting, active, and playful. They will avoid sedentary forms of learning and uninteresting learning assignments. They will also avoid reading assignments that are not succinct, practical and relevant. Artisans want to demonstrate their learning through actions.</p>
</p>
<p><b>Stress:</b> As a defense mechanism, Artisans may respond with denial, insisting that a fact is untrue despite overwhelming evidence. Since Artisans feel a need to make an impact and to be spontaneous, they become stressed when their ability to do these things becomes constrained. Boredom is another source of stress for Artisans. When under stress, they can become reckless, and they may retaliate against the source of the stress. Providing Artisans with options, such as new ways to make an impact and new activities, can relieve the stress.
