<h1>ENTP</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Extraverted: ENTPs enjoy interacting with a wide variety of people. They are great conversationalists and love to engage other people in debates.</li>
    <li>Intuitive: ENTPs are more focused on the future rather than on immediate details. They may start projects and never finish them because they are so focused on the big picture rather than the present needs.</li>
    <li>Thinking: ENTPs are logical and objective. When making decisions, they place a greater weight on rational evidence instead of subjective, emotional information.</li>
    <li>Perceiving: ENTPs tend to reserve judgment. Instead of making a decision or committing to a course of action, they would prefer to wait and see what happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>ENTPs Are Extroverted
<br/>Since they are identified as extroverts, it may come as no surprise that ENTPs have very good people skills. They are skilled communicators and enjoy interacting with a wide circle of family, friends and acquaintances.
</p>

<p>In conversations, other people often find them quick-witted.
</p>

<p>ENTPs will often engage in debates simply because they enjoy having a good battle of the wits. Sometimes, their love of debates lead ENTPs to take on the role of the devil's advocate, which can sometimes lead to conflicts with others who feel like they are being intentionally combative and antagonistic.
</p>

<p>ENTPs are also known for being idea-oriented, which is why this personality type has been described as "the innovator," "the visionary," and "the explorer." However, as perceivers, ENTPs are less interested in the here-and-now details than they are in generating ideas and theories. Because of this, they sometimes tend to come up with one idea after another without actually going forward with plans and actions to bring their creative notions into fruition.
