<h1>INTP</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Introversion (I): INTPs prefer to socialize with a small group of close friends.</li>
    <li>Intuition (N): INTPs tend to think about the big picture, rather than focusing on every tiny detail.</li>
    <li>Thinking (T): INTPs are logical and base decisions on objective information rather than subjective feelings.</li>
    <li>Perceiving (P): INTPs like to keep their options open and feel limited by structure and planning.</li>
</ul>

<p>INTPs Are Introverts
<br/>As introverts, INTPs prefer spending time alone for the most part. Unlike extraverts who gain energy from interacting with a wide group of people, introverts must expend energy in social situations. After being around a lot of people, an INTP might feel like they need to spend some time alone to recharge and find balance.
</p>

<p>While they may be shy around people they do not know well, INTPs tend to be warm and friendly with their close group of family and friends.
</p>

<p>INTPs Are Independent
<br/>INTPs can be very independent and place a great deal of emphasis on personal freedom and autonomy. In some cases, they can be aggravated by authority figures, particularly those that they feel are trying to suppress their ability to think and act for themselves. Because of this, INTPs typically do best in careers with they have a great deal of flexibility and independence.
</p>

<p>Because INTPs enjoy solitude and deep thinking, they sometimes strike others as aloof and detached. At times, people with this personality type can get lost in their own thoughts and lose track of the outside world. They love ideas and place a high value on intelligence and knowledge.
</p>

<p>In social situations, INTPs tend to be quite easy-going and tolerant. However, they can become unyielding when their beliefs or convictions are challenged. Their high emphasis on logic can make it difficult to not correct others in situations where other people present arguments that are not rational or logical.
</p>

<p>Because they rely on their own minds rather than others, they can also be very difficult to persuade.
