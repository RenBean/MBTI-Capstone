<h1>IENTJ</h1>

<ul>
<li>Extroverted: People with this personality type enjoy spending time with other people. They have strong verbal skills and interacting with others helps them feel energized.</li>
<li>Intuitive: ENTJ prefer to think about the future rather than focus on the here-and-now. They usually find abstract and theoretical information more interesting that concrete details.</li>
<li>Thinking: When making decisions, ENTJs place a greater emphasis on objective and logical information. Personal feeling and the emotions of others tend not to factor much into their choices.</li>
<li>Judging: ENTJs are planners. Making decisions and having a schedule or course of action planned out gives them a sense of predictability and control.</li>
</ul>

<p>ENTJs Are Extroverted
    <br/>Since ENTJs are extroverts, they gain energy from socializing (unlike introverts, who expend energy in social situations). They love having passionate and lively conversations and debates. In some cases, other people can feel intimidated by the ENTJs confidence and strong verbal skills. When they have a good idea, people with this personality type feel compelled to share their point of view with others.
</p>

<p>ENTJs Are Leaders
<br/>Thanks to their comfort in the spotlight, ability to communicate, and tendency to make quick decisions, ENTJs tend to naturally fall into leadership roles. In his book Please Understand Me II, David Keirsey points out that these individuals sometimes find themselves taking control of a group without really knowing how they came to be in such a position. Because of their love for structure and order, the ENTJ is also good at supervising and directing others and helping groups complete tasks and achieve goals.
</p>

<p>They are able to quickly see what needs to be accomplished, develop a plan of action, and assign roles to group members.
</p>

<p>Despite their verbal abilities, ENTJs are not always good at understanding other people's emotions. Expressing emotions can be difficult for them at times, and their tendency to get into debates can make them seem aggressive, argumentative, and confrontational. People can overcome this problem by making a conscious effort to think about how other people might be feeling.
